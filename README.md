# AH Goblin

AH Goblin is a web application that allows you to manage your World of Warcraft
auction house business so that you can experience the joy of swimming in piles
upon piles of fat, virtual currency.

## History

This project is no longer relevant in todays game, but was extensively used by
me during the Wrath of the Lich King, Cataclysm and Mist of Pandaria expansions
to manage my auction house business.

It allows doing many of the things that
[TradeSkillMaster](https://www.tradeskillmaster.com/) allows you to do today,
but a lot of those features were not available back in the day. This includes things like:

- Define what items you want to craft and sell, and whats required to make them.
- Track how to gather materials (eg. which items can be created by converting other items and such).
- Figure out what materials needs to be purchased and in what quantity to sustain the business.
- Figure out which in-game characters are responsible of stockpiling and
  selling items so that crafted items can be auto-mailed there.
- Exporting app data to be imported into other addons via the [AH Goblin companion addon](https://github.com/tanordheim/ahgoblin-wow-addon).
